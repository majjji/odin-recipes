    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a traditional paraguayan dish called <em>"chipa"</em>, it is neither a dessert or main meal. <em>Chipa</em> is a food that is eaten at any moment of the day,it can be your breakfast, dessert, afternoon snack or as we say in spanish, "merienda". A simple dish but with amazing reach, it is in my opinion the perfect recipe.</p>
        <p>You will need only a few ingredients and a lot of work on the mass with your hands you will have a perfect and delicious kind of bread dish. I recommend to eat chipa with coffee or with <a href="cocido.html">cocido</a> which is a delicious paraguayan drink that goes perfect with it.</p>
